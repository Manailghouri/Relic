// Roha to laiba manail : ONLY INCLUDE GET, POST FUNCTIONS FOR NOW


// searchHistoricalNews is a function that will be called when the html form button is clicked
// (the main html form button will be handled by a separate js, lets just figure that out later)

// searchHistoricalNews is responsible for accepting the form data (a search query)
// and then calling get-data.php. Waiting for a response and then showing the search results back
// get-data.php will talk to the db and fetch the data then return it back to this js function here
// example-flow: form button pressed -> searchHistoricalNews called -> searchHistoricalNews calls get-data.php -> and then send some validation back to the user

// test whether the js script is properly loaded

// the first thing to run after the page is loaded;
// would be to connect to the db
// this function below will directly run the db.php function to connect to the database
// optionally i think that php should return the $conn object, so that it may be used by
// other funcitons in the file (to reduce the number of times db.php is called)
